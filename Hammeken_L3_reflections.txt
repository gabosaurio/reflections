When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
 local?

  I would use it to avoid cluttering my hard drive and to collaborate with other
  developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because if Git automatically updated it might push new changes without me
  noticing when collaborating with other people.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

  A fork is a copy of another person's repository that is taken from and copied
  to GitHub. This is helpful if you don't have permission to push changes into
  the other person's repository.
  A clone is a copy of a repository, which can be created locally or from
  GitHub to your machine. This is helpful when you want to edit a project or
  change its location.
  Finally a branch is an alternative commit path which helps fix bugs or
  implement new features.
