When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
 local?

  I would use it to avoid cluttering my hard drive and to collaborate with other
  developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because if Git automatically updated it might push new changes without me
  noticing when collaborating with other people.
